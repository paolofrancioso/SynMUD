## How to start

Git Clone or download project. Go to src folder:
- make clean
- make

Best way to boot the mud is "nohup startup <port> &" in src directory.
'nohup' is an abbreviation of 'no halt user process', which prevents 
killing the mud's process when you logoff your user in the shell.
You can also type sh qstart from src folder. Default Port is 9500.
You can change it in startup file.

For an easier start to get your mud going, there is a premade
level 36 administrator named 'admin'. The password is 'admin'.

You should immediately change your name and password. This obviously goes 
without saying, but. Who knows.
